This is a relatively simple API wrapper around SendSonar.com's messaging service.  

This API is designed for use with both Flask and Django, so it is written to be as agnostic as possible. It probably won't work to include it in your INSTALLED_APPS in django or the equivalent in Flask.  

Just import it directly.

All of the endpoints will be exposed via this API that are exposed via the offical SendSonar API.
